# Impact of Daily Excercises on Performance in Intermediate Microeconomics

We developed R scripts as part of a project for my econometrics course. We ran regressions to examine factors impacting performance in Intermediate Microeconomics using traditional linear regression approaches. We used datasets provided by Prof. Yonggyun Kim from his Intermediate Microeconomics class in Fall 24. The research paper which includes regression results and graphs from the script is attached below.
